The staff around the pool bar, breakfast/dinner areas do not seem bothered at all with being there or creating positive guest experience. We had better customer service across different bars, restaurants and locations on our trip, so we don't believe it was a cultural difference, just poor customer service.

Food - If you're happy with ""school dinner"" quality and a lack of choice, you'll be ok. We're glad we weren't all-inclusive. Eating out was definitely the right choice here.

Hotel / Room - incredibly basic. Uncomfortable beds, door handles missing, sink plug not connected and getting stuck. Feels like a poor construction job. Oh and we were lucky enough to have a chronic smoker next door stinking out the whole floor. 🙄

Departures are equally disorganized. There's no clear separation between local and international passengers, leading to crowded and confusing areas with minimal signage or direction. Again, expect staff to approach offering 'assistance' and then aggressively demand payment (expect $10+). Check-in and security procedures are highly inefficient; all luggage is manually inspected as there are no scanners, so keep a close eye on your bags to prevent loss. Be prepared for a mandatory and enforced $55 airport tax, and health officials may demand payment for alleged typhoid and cholera vaccinations ($10).

This mall is honestly one of the best places I’ve ever visited! It’s not just a shopping center ,it’s a complete experience. Whether you’re looking to spend a relaxing day with friends, enjoy some quality family time, or simply treat yourself, this mall has something for everyone.

The range of stores is incredible ,  with affordable clothing shops and everything in between. I also really appreciated the well-stocked grocery stores that made it easy to grab both essentials and specialty items. It’s super convenient to get all your shopping done in one place.

But what really sets this mall apart is the entertainment. There are cinemas, gaming zones, fun activities for kids, and even occasional live performances. You’ll never be bored here. The food court is also impressive, offering a wide variety of cuisines from all over the world ,whether you’re in the mood for a quick snack or a sit-down meal, you’ll find plenty of options.

On top of all that, the design of the mall is just stunning. It’s spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated, with natural lighting and stylish architecture that makes walking around a pleasure. Definitely worth a visit ,it’s more than just a mall, it’s a destination.",False

Five stars for the hotel - but the self-proclaimed enclosed “best restaurant on São Tomé” was somewhat disappointing.

I’m not usually one to complain on destinations such as STP, but with prices like Omali’s and the pretentious image they aim to project, I would expect top quality all around. Here’s what happened: from the menu I ordered “pan-fried steak with Omali mustard sauce.” The waiter asked me if I wanted it rare, medium, or well done. I chose medium-rare, but the steak I was served was thoroughly cooked. When I pointed this out, the waiter looked confused, took the steak away, and came back with an even more cooked one. At that point, I gave up, as he clearly did not understand (we don’t speak Portuguese).

I did, however, ask about the missing “mustard sauce.” Again I got a confused look, and was asked to show what I meant on the menu. I pointed out the Portuguese description, and the waiter eventually returned… with a bowl of the same gravy the steak had been cooked in.

Normally, I wouldn’t mind, but at these prices - and given the high standards the hotel wants to convey - this shouldn’t happen. If the waiter doesn’t understand, he should check with a co-worker rather than making the wrong decisions on his own.",False

308,Bakaara Market,Other,Mogadishu,Somalia,2.0473721,45.3188945,,,,,"Bakaara Market, located in Mogadishu, Somalia, is a bustling and historically significant open-air market. It is the largest market in the country and a central hub for trade and commerce.
Here's a review of what you can expect, based on available information:
Overview of the Market
* Size and Scope: Bakaara is a massive market, often described as a city within a city. It's the economic heart of Mogadishu, selling everything from daily essentials like maize, sorghum, beans, and other food items to clothing, household goods, and even building materials and gold.
* Historical Significance: The market was established in the early 1970s. It has a complex history, having been a center of conflict and a stronghold for various militias and extremist groups in the past. However, in recent years, with the withdrawal of Al-Shabaab from the capital, it has been revitalized and is now a symbol of Mogadishu's economic recovery.
* Goods and Products: You can find a wide variety of goods here. While it's known for daily necessities, it has also historically been associated with illicit activities, such as the sale of counterfeit documents and weapons. Today, the focus is more on legitimate trade, including a large and vibrant livestock market.
Customer Experience
* Atmosphere: The market is described as incredibly lively, crowded, and loud. It's a sensory experience, with a constant buzz of activity, from vendors calling out to customers to the general hustle and bustle of a major commercial center.
* Safety and Security: The market's reputation for safety has been a major concern in the past due to sporadic violence and conflict. However, reports suggest that with increased security measures and the stabilization of Mogadishu, it is generally considered safer than it once was. Nonetheless, it's still a place that requires a high degree of caution, especially for foreign visitors. It is highly recommended to have a knowledgeable local guide.
* Cleanliness and Organization: Some recent accounts mention that the market is ""surprisingly somewhat too clean,"" with organized stores and bright lights. This suggests that there have been significant improvements in the market's infrastructure and management. However, it's still a busy, open-air market, so you can expect a degree of dirt and mud, particularly at entrances.
* Food: The market is a great place to find local food. Some visitors have mentioned ""shack-like 'restaurants'"" with delicious food and generous portions.
* Interaction with Locals: Visitors can expect to be called out by vendors, often respectfully, encouraging them to visit their stores. People are generally described as friendly and welcoming, but it's an environment where you'll get a lot of attention.
In summary, Bakaara Market is a fascinating and essential part of Mogadishu. It represents both the challenges and the resilience of the city. While it has a troubled past, it is now a thriving economic hub that offers a unique and authentic glimpse into daily life in Somalia. Visiting requires awareness and a cautious approach, but it can be a rewarding experience.",False

If there was an option  give infinity stars, I would.

The last time I came to her, I was extremely sick and throwing up and I had been to so many doctors and specialists and nothing was working. After my holistic consultation with her, she explained that my solar plexus (which is above my stomach) was out of balance and causing these stomach upsets. She explained the spiritual reasons for it and it resonated so much with what was currently going on in my life. After she performed the reiki on me, I immediately felt so much  lighter and the vomitting spells stopped! She also helped me with my other chakras and I remember leaving her office feeling like I wanted to skip. She also got downloads from my spirit team that was extremely spot on and gave me guidance that was really helpful and so needed.

I came to her again now because I am extremely stuck in terms of my life moving forward and it as making me really sick and I had a lot of anxiety and really bad depression. I would wake up every morning and immediately have a  panic attack at the thought of having to go through my day. It was extremely debilitating. We  did a distant reiki session and if you had any doubts about its effectiveness please push it aside right now because I can with absolute certainty confirm that its real and it works. My session was split into three and after each one I felt MASSIVELY better. After the  first one I felt so good that I was finally able to eat a full meal for the first time in 3 weeks. I no longer had panic ttacks or heart palpitations and my feelings of despair lessened  after every session. I felt so calm and at peace.

Not only had my health improved physically and mentally but I also got so much information on my chakras and  it all resonated so much and just gave me so much clarity.

Charmaine is also the nicest person to interact with and she genuinely cares  about her clients and  go above and beyond. Both times she checked in with me afterwards and gave such beautiful words of encouragement. She truly is the embodiment of  an earth angel.

I am so grateful for her and highly recommend that you give it a try. Her prices are also very low given that she is a Grand Master level 9 reiki healer so her reiki is a lot  stronger than other level 3 healers who charge the same price. So I would definitely give it a try, this has helped me more than any doctor or therapist ever could combined in the last decade.",False

352,Vijana Mall,Other,Dar es Salaam,Tanzania,-6.8140301,39.2776165,https://m.facebook.com/AuraMallTanzania/?ref=page_internal&mt_nav=1,,+255 22 277 4253,,"Last weekend, I decided to explore Vijana Mall, a relatively new and rising commercial center that I had heard quite a bit about. The mall is located in a strategic area that’s easily accessible by both private and public transport, which made getting there simple and convenient.

First Impressions:
As I arrived, the first thing that caught my eye was the modern architecture of the building. The design is sleek, with clean glass panels and bold signage. The entrance was wide and welcoming, with security personnel politely guiding visitors in. There was a clear sense of order and safety, which gave me a good first impression.

Interior and Layout:
Inside, the mall is well-organized, with wide corridors, bright lighting, and clear signboards that make navigation very easy. It has three floors, each offering a mix of retail, service, and leisure spaces. The ground floor is mostly taken up by local fashion boutiques, electronics shops, and a few well-known fast-food outlets.

Shops and Services:
One thing I appreciated was the variety of businesses housed in the mall. I came across youth-owned shops selling creative streetwear, handmade crafts, and even custom phone accessories. There’s a mobile repair hub that was quite busy, and several salons and barber shops offering affordable grooming services.

On the second floor, there were more service-oriented businesses like travel agencies, microfinance offices, and a cyber café. The top floor is partly dedicated to a co-working space and a small event hall that’s often rented for business expos or youth trainings.

Food Court and Social Vibe:
The food court is one of the highlights. It offers both local Tanzanian dishes and international options like pizza, shawarma, and smoothies. The prices were fair, and the service was quick. I sat at a corner table overlooking the street and enjoyed a fresh plate of chips mayai with a cold soda.

What really stood out to me was the vibrant energy of the mall. It was filled with young entrepreneurs, creatives, and students—some were networking, some shopping, others just hanging out. There was even a small pop-up stand for a youth-run business selling natural skincare products.

Final Thoughts:
Vijana Mall isn’t just a place to shop—it’s a hub of youth innovation and enterprise. It promotes local talent and creates opportunities for young people to showcase their skills and build their brands. I left feeling inspired by the energy and creativity in that space.

Whether you’re looking to shop, eat, connect, or even start a business, Vijana Mall is definitely worth a visit.",False

Their insights were invaluable in guiding us through our project, and they provided tailored solutions that addressed our unique needs.

Moreover, the level of transparency and integrity displayed by ZATRA is commendable. They kept us informed at every stage and delivered their services promptly without compromising quality. It's clear that they prioritize building long-term relationships with their clients rather than just focusing on short-term gains.

There was so much to move about this place. We loved the location- just 50m from the beach, the fish market restaurant was delicious, cheap and only 70ms away from the hotel.
The rooms were decent and the customer service from Peter was incredible. He went above and beyond to help us out when we needed reef walkers, tour/beach/food recommendations, and we genuinely liked him as a person! He even made us breakfast on one of the mornings himself. The fruit and juice for breakfast all other mornings was refreshing and we enjoyed sitting on the rooftop. Florian was also amazing- a reliable driver. If you take the time to walk up and down the beach to the left (facing the ocean), you can explore many restaurants and stunning water. The beach to the right is less busy and clean.
Unfortunately there was a major security issue 3 nights after we were there as we moved into a room thats window was not locked prior to us moving in (we did not touch the lock). Someone broke in as we slept. Management started to improve/increase security due to this. Hopefully they have followed through and sorted this out.",False

Tips :
- you need to be able to swim as you’ve to swim across some path with a bit of current (not too much tho) but it’s perfectly safe as there are ropes and really amazing staff to help you.
- bring your own waterproof shoes with grip or rent some for 2$ at the departure. You will need it! No flipflops (you gonna loose them in the falls anyway except if you’ve a good toe-grip haha)!

The staff were exceptional, always attentive and friendly. There were multiple staff who stood out including Dennis who took care of us the whole time. The hotel also had a regular bus service into town which we took to Victoria Falls and to take out cash.

We also did a day trip safari to Botswana through the hotel which was just unforgettable. The hotel arranged us being driven to Botswana and back, as well as the safari itself. Would recommend getting the double Zimbabwe Visa on arrival if you want to do that.

-I didn’t gain entry of the space until close to 45 minutes after my rental time had started. My timeslot was from 10-12, I didn’t get access to the space until 10:42, my first photoshoot was at 10:45. So you’re paying $200 to rent a space that you may or may not gain access to- depending on if the owner of the space hears his phone.
Speaking of which:

- For a company with very specific instructions to call the owner of the space for permission to access the space, they were very lackadaisical about answering their phone- which is a google number, the only phone number provided for the business. I called them no less than 10 times, before contacting their instagram page, and calling 2 more times before someone finally picked up. At that point, my clients were already there, and I had less than 5 minutes before their shoot time was supposed to start. After a brief exchange where the owner tried to blame-shift (he didn’t ‘see that I had called that many times’) I learned that the entry code they give in the email was all I needed, and that I didn’t need to call in order to access, it was just a courtesy to call- their instructions didn’t give that impression, at all.

- my message to the owner of Vera Lofts on instagram in general simply was read, there was no apology, there is no acknowledgment of my message, no response whatsoever. The whole exchange was very piss poor. I did make a request for a refund- perhaps that prompted the lack of response.
- In order to accommodate for my time loss, they saw it fit to give me the time I lost  in the following timeslot. However, that was not a proper solution. my photo shoots were planned for the timeslot that I paid for, so I would literally just be sitting in the space with no reason to use said space.
- And to top it all off, the space was much, MUCH dimmer than advertised, it is extremely dark in the indoor portion of the space, and there are boxes/containers visible in some aspects of the space.
So overall, it was a negative experience. It seems they are fine tailored to take your money, but are definitely lacking in customer care and coming up with proper solutions to accommodate mistakes made on their part- that’s too much of an investment made on the client’s part for them not to be performing in excellence. I’ll definitely be warning as many photographers that I can about them.",False

I first reached out to her after a friend of a friend suggested she might be able to help me process the deep anger and sadness I had been carrying for months. I was emotionally drained, desperate for relief, and willing to try anything that could help ease the turmoil I felt inside.

From our very first phone consultation, I knew I had found someone special. Suzanne is warm, intuitive, and incredibly easy to talk to. I felt safe opening up to her—something that hasn’t come easily for me in the past. When she said she believed she could help me, I felt a genuine sense of hope for the first time in a long while.

Each session with Suzanne brought a new layer of healing. I began to feel lighter, more balanced, and less weighed down by the emotions that had consumed me for so long. The anger began to fade. Life didn’t seem quite so heavy anymore.

But what surprised me most were the unexpected ripple effects of our work together—my creativity started to flourish, my self-confidence returned, and my productivity soared. I was so energized that I even took on a third career path, in addition to my full-time job and ongoing certification program.

I don’t fully understand how Suzanne works her magic, but the results speak for themselves. The impact she’s had on my life is profound, and the sessions with her have been worth every single penny.

Starting with Gurpreet sir, the Akashic session was something I had never tried before, and honestly, I didn’t know what to expect. But the moment the session began, his calm and grounded energy made me feel so comfortable. He shared things about my past experiences, patterns, and thoughts I had never spoken to anyone about, and it felt like he was reading my soul. The answers I received gave me so much clarity about my life path and helped me release a lot of emotional heaviness I had been carrying for years. It wasn’t just a session — it was a healing experience that made me feel lighter, more connected to myself, and hopeful for the future.

A few days later, I had my astrology session with Acharya Tulika, and she was equally wonderful in her own way. She explained my birth chart and planetary positions so simply, without using heavy or confusing terms. What amazed me was how accurately she spoke about my personality, relationships, career struggles, and current emotional state, without me having to say much. She didn’t just tell me about the problems — she gave me easy, practical remedies that I could genuinely follow in my day-to-day life. The way she guided me made me feel so supported and cared for.

Both sessions, though different in approach, complemented each other beautifully. Together, they helped me understand where I was stuck, why certain patterns kept repeating in my life, and what I needed to do to move forward with peace and confidence. I feel much more positive, aware, and aligned after these experiences.

I genuinely recommend Make Me Pure, Gurpreet Singh Arora, and Acharya Tulika to anyone who’s looking for clarity, healing, and guidance. It’s not just about astrology or spirituality here — it’s about reconnecting with yourself on a deeper level.",False

We started talking to the venue around 6 months before the event and started planning it, our points of contact Sunil L and Kenneth were an absolute delight to work with.

Sunil, their in house event manager, and also pretty much the venue manager at aura spent countless hours with us during decor planning, he patiently listened to everything we had to say about our vision for the event and recommended his own unique ideas that would work within our theme.

Sunil was available on call 24x7 during the event and the 3 days prior to our event, he made sure he did everything within his power to fulfil our last minute special requests, he even helped set one of our guests up in his office because they had to take a work call on the evening of 29th

It was surreal to have witnessed all the ideas we presented and Sunil also presented come to life on the day of the event, there was a welcome ceremony my side of the family had to do before we kicked things off on the 29th and walking through the stairway and seeing all the decor elements setup up so beautifully was a experience I get to cherish for the rest of my life.

Everything we were worried about or thought might stress us out on the day of was handled beautifully by Sunil and his team and they ensured everything flowed Seamlessly.

Would be back if I ever visit the area again.

EDIT: Had to come back to rewrite this review due to a recent incident.

While at the 4m deep pool, we were unfortunate to have encountered a young man who was alongside us who ended up drowning despite our best efforts to save him. In the process, we were trying to perform CPR and looking for an AED to revive him, however, none of the staff available at the time were trained. This meant that they were unable to assist us, and when the ambulance arrived, none were also confident enough to follow the poor man to the hospital. As a result, a couple of my friends (guests at the hotel) were the ones who had to help the man.

When asked about this, the hotel said the pool should be closed at 6pm. This incident happened around 7pm. So, where are  the safety precautions in place?

1. There is no lifeguard for a 4 metre deep pool.

2. There is no enforcement of the pool closure rules.

The hotel staff merely told us they thought it would be fine because we were in a big group.

Aurora Place @ Bukit Jalil Review

Aurora Place is not really a shopping mall you walk around for fun, but if you happen to work or stay nearby, it’s actually quite convenient to drop by. Got makan places, cafes, some offices, clinics, and even a gym – so everything also ada sikit-sikit.

Even though not much to explore like a full-blown mall, if you walk here from nearby condos or Pavilion Bukit Jalil, it’s still very accessible. There’s even a link bridge straight to Pavilion, so quite senang if you want to avoid the crowd and just chill somewhere quieter.

Food-wise, not bad – got variety. From local stalls to Korean BBQ, Japanese restaurants, and a few nice coffee places to lepak or do laptop work. Weekend sometimes got pop-up stalls downstairs, so got a bit of life here and there.

Parking is usually okay, and not too expensive. Security and cleanliness also boleh tahan. Good place to settle errands or grab a quick bite without squeezing through a packed mall.

Overall, maybe not a place to purposely come jalan-jalan, but for nearby residents or office crowd – memang convenient.",False

Nepa Rudraksha truly feels like a divine destination for authentic Rudraksha. I recently placed an order and received it within 7–10 days, which was impressive.

We are planning to place the Shivlinga in our home temple this week, and we’re excited to begin performing Rudrabhishek at home whenever we wish. Every Rudraksha I’ve received so far has brought meaningful results and supported me greatly in my spiritual journey.

I’ve also ordered a Rudraksha book authored by the esteemed Mr. Sukritya. Just by browsing through its contents, I can already sense the depth of knowledge it offers on Rudraksha and its rich history. My heartfelt thanks to Sukritya ji for creating such a valuable resource.

I’m writing to raise a concern regarding an incident I experienced today at the Cebu Exchange Tower.

Earlier, I was waiting for my cousin at the open space across Union Bank, which seemed like a reasonable and safe waiting spot. After a short while, a guard approached me and told me that waiting there was not allowed and pointed me toward the entrance area instead — a location where people are constantly walking by. I was confused because the area I was in appeared to be a proper space for waiting.

I understand that the guards are just doing their job and following protocol, and I respect that. However, the situation was confusing and a bit frustrating, as there were no signs indicating that waiting in that area was prohibited. It made me wonder — what exactly is the purpose of that space? If it’s not meant for waiting, then perhaps the management can consider placing clear signage, or better yet, creating a designated waiting area.

I’ve also noticed similar instances in the past where guards were somewhat abrupt when approaching riders. While I understand the need to keep the area organized, a little more courtesy and clarity would really help create a more welcoming environment.

I’m sharing this not to cause trouble, but in the hope that improvements can be made for the benefit of everyone visiting your building.",False

I came to pay, and no one even contacted me. I called them and they said, ""We've had enough."" There were also people who had registered and paid!!!!!

So, how did you let my children go like this without prior notice? They come every day and have become attached to the place, and it has become part of their summer vacation. I have already set up transportation, scheduled their time, and paid for it.

This really bothered me. This is a random system. There's no respect for customers. The children only see you as a number and money.

May God suffice and be my protector. Just as I lost money and peace of mind, may God restore my rights from Him.",False

The products are expensive but seriously high quality. The window display is very successful, the decoration is wonderful, it is a simple store that does not tire people. The lighting is very successful, it is one of the rare brands/stores where you can walk around in peace and where the products are not stacked as if they are about to collapse. There is even harmony in the product colors. The only thing I would criticize about this place is this, that's why I took off one star. It's probably because it's told to employees, but this kind of approach is a thing of the past. You want to go in and walk around, but a staff member constantly walks 1 meter behind you, and when you take 2 steps, he moves too. What were you looking at? Brother, I didn't look at anything, I'm just wandering around, maybe something will catch my attention, it's a product that I haven't planned before, I won't shop on purpose, maybe I'll buy it when I see it. I'll like it at that moment, maybe I'll buy it when I don't even think about it. I entered it many times, I got the same treatment, believe me, I don't enter it anymore. It is a spotlessly clean store, the shelves are always neat, not messy, everything is placed in an orderly manner, they fix it immediately after distribution. It looks shiny.
Also, during this pandemic period, those who enter are not asked for their HES code and there is no temperature check. This place is located within Bilkent Center but on the ground floor. You can park your car in the Lower Car Park and enter the store directly without any questions. There is no control. When entering the Milkrnt Center shopping area, yes, there is a HES code inquiry and temperature measurement while passing through the door, but this area is outside that area. You can enter directly. I couldn't find it suitable for such a brand. I am currently sitting on the benches in the middle area and watching for 20 minutes. They do not control those who enter in any way, and this is a very important deficiency. Such brands need to pioneer some things and set an example.

Hydrogen (H₂) is considered one of the most powerful antioxidants known for the following reasons:

Hydrogen molecules are extremely small and can quickly penetrate cell membranes and even enter organelles such as mitochondria, exerting an antioxidant effect directly at the source of free radical generation.

It is selective and only neutralizes the most destructive hydroxyl radicals (OH·) and peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻), without interfering with free radicals that are beneficial to the body (such as hydrogen peroxide, NO), so it will not interfere with normal physiological functions.

Hydrogen can activate the body's own antioxidant enzyme system (such as the Nrf2 pathway), promote the production of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione and catalase, and further enhance antioxidant capacity.

It is natural and safe, and will eventually turn into water after entering the body. It will not cause toxicity or side effects like other water-soluble antioxidants (such as vitamin C), so there is no need to worry about overdose.

Studies have shown that hydrogen helps reduce inflammation, cell apoptosis, allergic reactions, and protects DNA and proteins from oxidative damage.

Summary: Hydrogen is considered to be one of the most powerful and ideal antioxidants because of its extremely small molecules, strong selectivity, ability to activate the body's own antioxidant system, and safety without side effects.",False

1.	The rooms could have been cleaned more thoroughly. A bit more attention to cleanliness would make a big difference.
2.	Since we booked a room with breakfast included, we expected slightly better quality. For example, the orange juice tasted more like water than juice – it seemed to be about 90% water.

Service
The owners and hosts are incredibly attentive and kind. From your initial greeting to send off Nina and Pasi make you feel like valued patrons of an exclusive experience. The staff is also kind and accommodating, with great recommendations and knowledge of the surrounding area. We also booked all excursions through the resort which made coordination very convenient. We enjoyed the aurora hunting and husky excursion, both were very enjoyable. The main dining had great breakfast included, limited lunch options, and delicious rotating dinner menu.
Location
Located only 35 minutes from Ivalo airport the resort was easy to get to and the resort also offers arranged transportation, for a reasonable fee.
Room
The rooms were great with great scenic views from the room. There is a dedicated small space for luggage and clothes to be hung along with a bathroom that’s small but luxurious. We enjoyed the room overall, however I’ll note there is no way to block the morning sun and no full length mirror.",False

They offer loads of fun activities that include all your winter gear you need. I recommend all the activities that are available, we loved every single thing we did.

The cabin itself is just stunning, we saw the Aurora lights every evening right from our bed. The property lights aren’t too bright, so it’s perfect to spot the lights from the property. The whole design and location of this place is just perfect.

The location at nearly 70 degree north latitude means you’re more likely to see the Aurora Borealis (though it ultimately comes down to a combination of the magnetosphere activity, weather and some luck).

The cabins were super cozy with washing machine, drying cabinet, dishwasher, fridge, showers, fireplace, and of course its own sauna. We stayed in their Asgaard B cottages which are their newest and come with the above amenities.

We chose a 4 night stay and saw the Aurora every night except for the last when we got a pretty big snowstorm. Some nights we viewed the AB from a large viewing tower right near the cabins. Other nights, we drove as far as Norway to see them, even stopping off the side of the road when the Borealis presented itself. At times it came and went quickly but when the activity was strong, we watched for 20-25 minutes at a time!

After being picked up from the airport (it’s about a 2+ hour drive up to the cabins), we were dropped off at a large grocery store to buy all the needed supplies for the week. We had 1 hour which is just enough to translate some Finnish product descriptions (outside the obvious fruits, veg, chips, etc).

Tony and team (Ian was really great, super helpful and also friendly and always made us feel so welcomed) offered activities on all days (the husky rides, ice-fishing, ice fall snow shoe walking, snowmobiling and reindeer farm visit) can be purchased à la carte and paid same day. This means you can plan them relatively last minute and if you prefer to just walk around the forest or rest in the cabins you can.

The tours also provided full snowsuits and the snowshoes if you needed.

Lastly, there is a covered common smoke pit near the viewing tower where we grilled artic fish one night, we saw our neighbors making smores and other foods too.

We had a great experience and would recommend them to anyone planning a trip up to see the Aurora Borealis!",False

During my last moments in Frankfurt, since my ticket was delayed, I had to quickly book a hotel.
First of all, I’m really thankful for the Agoda app—it makes searching with filters so easy and offers great deals.
This hotel was one of their recommendations.
It was about a 7-minute walk from the train station, and even though it was late at night, I walked there.
I asked around about safety, and apparently, it’s not recommended to walk around that area after midnight.
But I absolutely loved the location—it gave me easy access to everywhere and everything was nearby.
My room was so clean, spacious, and nice.
There was even a welcoming package.
I honestly think everything was perfect.
I didn’t have time to interact much with the staff, but even with the limited contact, they were very helpful and kind.
I was satisfied with everything, and if I go to Frankfurt again, I’ll definitely choose this place.
Oh, and their prices are amazing!

Good location
Nice interior though not sure about the giant portrait of Sisi watching me sleep…

No one greets you at the entrance
No help with bags
No concierge
No clarity on Spa rules, some people walking around naked, some with bathing suits. No member of staff at the Spa desk.

Staff are just generally untrained and lack the experience to deliver what is required for 5 star. The hotel generally is nice but it lacks finesse and refinement that you normally expect at this price point. I will never come back nor would I stay at any of their group hotels.

The issues in Aura tullamore are more about the maintenance in the gym locker rooms (male and female).

The showers have chipped tiles, the lockers don't have any straps on any of the keys, and I can't even begin to describe the  toilet in the changing area. I've seen cleaner toilets at music festivals. They seem to be cleaned maybe once every day and there is hardly ever toilet paper.

The drains always smell quite badly, the tiles are covered in snot, chewing gum, and are cleaned very infrequently (i believe based on condition).

If you compare this to other facilities in the court hotel, or snap fitness they are far worse in terms of the changing facilities they have and also the cleanliness standards.

They also recently changed policy and my teenage son can't go post 6.30 which has limited his ability to train (he is a competitive swimmer and used to train evenings at the gym)

All in all since i rejoined this year (i was a member a long time ago) I'm far more inclined to go back to the court hotel or snap fitness due to everything described.

Aurae has been an invaluable guide on my journey towards self-discovery and personal growth. Here are five reasons why she is exceptional:

Aurae's deep understanding of Human Design has been transformative for me. Through her extensive reading and personalized guidance, I've gained profound insights into my unique design chart, allowing me to navigate life with clarity and purpose. Her energy, aura, and open-mindedness create a nurturing space for growth.

Aurae's commitment to her clients' growth is truly commendable. She goes above and beyond to ensure that I not only understand my Human Design but also integrate its principles into my daily life for long-lasting positive change. Her holistic knowledge, especially regarding the nervous system, money wounds, and Human Design, has deeply impacted me.

As a stress and leadership coach, Aurae equips her clients with practical tools to manage stress effectively. She sometimes calls me back into my body when I tend to fall into fear. Her gentle reminders and techniques help me shift from a state of anxiety to one of calmness and clarity, allowing me to approach challenges with resilience and confidence.

Being a member of Aurae's Health and Wealth Revolution has been a game-changer for me. Her holistic approach to financial wellbeing teaches us how to align our lives with prosperity, empowering us to achieve both financial success and personal fulfillment. It is an energetic shift combined with wisdom that I never had before.

Beyond her expertise, Aurae's genuine care and support make all the difference. Whether it's through a thoughtful message or her keen intuition, she always seems to know when I need encouragement or reassurance. She oversees very clearly and feels people next to analyzing her customers. She creates a safe and nurturing environment where I feel heard, understood, and empowered to embrace my true potential.

In summary, Aurae is not just a coach; she is a mentor, a guide, and a beacon of light on the path to self-discovery and holistic wellbeing. I am immensely grateful for her guidance and highly recommend her services to anyone seeking transformational change. Trust her fully, and you will embark on a journey of transformation and empowerment unlike any other.",False

I spent a day at The Reef Club using a day pass, and while the setting is undeniably beautiful, the experience was let down by poor communication and indifferent staff.

The location itself is lovely — clear water (a bit choppy as it’s open sea, not a bay), and there are little pockets of calm, including a sandy cove that’s great for swimming. There are plenty of sunbeds spread out across the club, so finding a quiet space to relax is easy, and the vibe is peaceful and scenic.

However, the staff really let the experience down.
When I arrived, I paid €45 at reception and was given no information at all — I only found out later (by asking) that there was a €65 option that included food vouchers. That was never mentioned to me. When I asked for a towel, I was told bluntly that they don’t provide towels — which honestly feels a bit absurd for a five-star hotel beach club charging premium rates. I did manage to get one eventually from a kind staff member, but the tone was not welcoming.

Beyond that, there was zero guidance:
•	No explanation of which areas I could access
•	No directions to the bar, restrooms, or restaurant
•	No schedule or info about service times
I was just vaguely gestured toward the sunbeds and left to figure it all out myself.

I made the best of it — had a good swim, relaxed, enjoyed a cocktail — but when I tried to order food a bit later, I found out the kitchen had closed at 3:30 PM. Again, no one told me this at any point. If I had known, I would’ve ordered lunch earlier.

It’s a real shame, because the physical space has a lot of potential and I still enjoyed my time there. But the lack of hospitality and basic service standards really made it feel like I was more of a nuisance than a guest.",False

You receive an email after booking,  telling you to be at the Ishavhotel prior to your departure time. Our hunt occurred on our second day in the city, and we were still a little unfamiliar with everything. We got to the hotel early. There were a few people standing around for other tours, but there was no signage there or tour representatives. Eventually there were a lot of people there and mini buses started showing up later. Suddenly guides started calling out names of their group. We were starting to worry there was a problem with our booking, but our names were finally called several groups later. This initial meeting seemed a bit chaotic, but the same process was used by three of the four tour providers, though one of them had a marked minibus that made it easy to spot.

There were only six of us in our group, so our minibus had plenty of room and was comfortable. Unfortunately, as the temperature dropped later in the hunt, the side door quit working; so, we had to lay back the driver's seat and climb in and out over it to get in and out of the minibus.

Our guide, Tomas, immediately explained the plan for the evening as we left Tromso. He was very engaging throughout the evening.  We discussed the science of the aurora, and he also told us about the native Sami culture. All of it was interesting. He was the second oldest of our five different guides.
He was mature and professional, but also very upbeat and excited about us seeing the aurora.

We drove three hours to the Finnish - Swedish border, near Keinovuopio, Sweden. We stopped once at a small store where snacks and toilets were available. We stopped again somewhere near Skibotin, Norway, where we saw a beautiful aurora display! Tomas took photos of the group and the aurora. He easily could have called it night, having seen the lights, but we drove on to the Keinovuopio area, where we set up for the rest of the evening. We were once again treated with a beautiful aurora show! Both spots were very picturesque!

The hunt included tripods, help with camera settings, a warm fire, food and drink, and warm clothing. Everyone in our group had their own photography equipment and there wasn't much discussion about settings. I feel certain assistance would have been given, if requested. The soup was rather bland, but it was hot and was fine for the circumstances. My wife used the provided boots and found them to be much warmer than her own. It was also nice that folding chairs were available for sitting by the fire later in the evening! The tour also included free web-size resolution photos and original resolution size photos were available for purchase. We purchased three of the higher resolution photos and received a separate link for downloading them. This link was only good for seven days. It would have been nice for the link to last longer, as we traveled for another three weeks. I would have liked to download the higher resolution photos directly to my home desktop computer.

After a long, enjoyable evening we packed up and headed back to Tromso, where we were dropped off at our hotel.

Despite the small issues discussed above, we found this to be an extremely enjoyable tour. We could not have had a better guide than Tomas! We're considering returning to Tromso for the next aurora season and will definitely book with Wondering Owl again!",False

Things only went downhill from there.

No air conditioning. In the middle of a heatwave, mind you. I was told, “It’s an old building,” as if that somehow excused them from providing a basic necessity. The room was a sauna, and when I asked for a fan, they shrugged and said, “We might have one. Try again later.”

Speaking of “old building,” that seems to be their excuse for everything. The appliances in the room looked like they were stolen from a thrift store in the 1980s and haven’t been cleaned since. The mini-fridge rattled like it was possessed, the microwave was missing half the buttons, and the TV only picked up static and despair.

The overall condition of the room? Grimy. Stained carpets, peeling wallpaper, and a bathroom that smelled faintly of mildew and stronger of regret.

Don’t be fooled by any filtered photos or half-hearted responses from management. This place is a rundown disaster run by people who clearly don’t care. I wouldn’t stay here again if it were free—and frankly, they should be paying guests to stay.

When we get there the ambiance is a full discotec or club. So first thing to notice, this was a club, and 2 months ago it also became a restaurant. So chairs, tables, look of the place and distributions were not good at all. Impressive at first because of the amount of space but as you stop and see details... It gets disappointing. Like for example a hole in a chair that was patched with black tape. The entrance is a long long bar that is completely alone... Kind of unsettling. From the start you feel a little bit weird. We pass the long bar/hallway entrance and we are greeted (will have loved to be greeted at the real entrance) by Jose Maria, who says it's the manager of the place, he was really chatty but with overall good attitude, a little bit to much into jokes but it was ok. We sit at the table and he keeps chatting, my friend (I was with my girlfriend and my friend who is visiting Barcelona) has little patience and cuts Jose right away and says ""Jose what about a beer first"" it was a bit rude from my friend part but you first need to make people confortable and then chat a lot, sorry for that Jose Maria. We asked for 3 beers, coronas, after asking us if we wanted lime with them we were then told that the coronas were not cold and that he could get us Budweiser (the manager didn't know what they have and what they didn't) ... I said no thanks, don't like watery beer. Jose Maria made us 3 cocktails so we could have something to drink, courtesy of the house, that was good, it shows they care about clients, but the cocktail was not really good at all besides being poorly presented... Non of us finished it, my friend ended up getting the Budweiser, my girl water, and I asked for a Cuba libre... Jose Maria was the manager, waiter and also the bartender, there was another bartender/waiter that was also a bouncer, they were really understaffed. At this point I had to teach Jose Maria how to make a Cuba libre... Which was fun but not what you expect from a restaurant or even bar... Later my girlfriend went to the bathroom and as she came back she said one of the toilets smelled horrible and had a lot of flies.... Then the food came... This is when I got mad, the food was barely eatable and not what you see in the photos, nothing was well thought or prepared, meat was processed (toro and cochinillo) and looked like you took it out of the fridge and put it in the microwave... Even with the 50% discount the food was not worth it... No plate was lower than 20€.. With the 50% discount they range from 10-13€... I wouldn't pay more than 5€ for what I was served... Please consider you can go to a normal michellin restaurant and one plate can cost you between 20-30€... This place is selling poorly prepared dishes for 26€... The place is really dark so when you see the dishes in the photos they look better than what they are. Also they have their own photos which don't represent at all the quality of food that we got served... I was open minded and friendly till the food arrived, that's when my face changed, we eat a little bit and asked for the bill right away, 60€ thrown away in my opinion. Jose Maria wasn't a bad host, but also not excellent, I assume it must be difficult if the place and food don't help. They told us that other days they have live music... Maybe this place is just good for drinks (beers, they don't have good bartenders, so I wouldn't recommend cocktails) and music... In conclusion Club that tries to be a restaurant in a fancy zone (above diagonal) and fails completely... Won't go there ever again... Waste of money, if you are hungry you are better off eating burgers or a kebad... That's how bad the quality of the food was here in relation to the price.

I tried to reach out to the center countless times, instagram, phone, whatsapp cause I really wanted to have such treatment and also they still had my little deposit.

I was always extremely and needlessly polite with this team of people, while in reality they’re so entitled and also stole 10 euros from me a this point.

Pros:
1) The area is well landscaped, everything is in flowers!
2) There are always available rooms (double room $20/night without meals)
Of the minuses:
1) Soviet service in its entirety (service from the position of “where are you going”)
2) A working refrigerator with freezer was found in only one of the five rooms offered
3) A broken toilet seat (they replaced it “smacking their lips displeasedly” with a whole one, but even the whole one was so uncomfortable that after leaving, my legs hurt for another 5 days)
4) The plumbing is all in a rusty and unsatisfactory condition (there is only cold water on the washbasins and no sprayer, the mixer in the shower was covered in machine oil, perhaps because of this, the water had an unpleasant smell, while we were looking for a room with a freezer, I saw a unique toilet tank: instead of a button there is a hole, with a rope sticking out of it with a ring that needs to be pulled!)
5) Single beds are put together and there is foam rubber between them, and the bed linen is only single bed linen - no matter how you sleep, it still lies on the seam, but the truth is you don’t feel it compared to faulty springs in the mattress
6) Meals are provided only in the base canteen, although they said on the phone that there is a shared kitchen. And there are no cutlery sets in the rooms; they are given the bare minimum, “smacking their lips displeasedly”: a spoon, a fork, a small plate, a cup, and only on request. There is a shared kitchen in the gazebo, but with one gas stove (when the wind blows out the fire) with four burners. In the common kitchen there are no utensils for cooking, i.e. there is nothing at all. Everyone is welcome! once you go to the dining room, look for the administrator Lyudmila Ivanovna and ask for a frying pan (without a handle!) or a saucepan (old Soviet aluminum). It’s better not to ask for a frying pan and a saucepan at the same time, so as not to hear a “dissatisfied smacking” with the words “Are you going to cook borscht!?!” or “cheaper than in our canteen, food is not possible!”
The prices in the dining room are greatly inflated; one complex for one will cost about $5. Thanks to the infrastructure of the area (a shop is a 2-minute walk away and a market is 5 minutes away), you can organize, on your own, five times a day! a complete balanced diet for two! person it turned out to be $5 a day! Additional expenses for food included the purchase of a personal frying pan for $7 and a saucepan for $10 in the center of Kirillovka (travel by minibus (every ten minutes) one way per person is $0.38), so as not to spoil your vacation by communicating with the dissatisfied administration.",False

The session was a perfect blend of relaxation, upliftment, and positivity, leaving me feeling rejuvenated and centered. After the session, I would advise to take around 30 minutes to readjust and find a quiet space in the studio (if available) to fully absorb the experience.

Thimela's guidance to drink plenty of water post-session and opting for a taxi ride home to preserve my energy was a thoughtful touch that enhanced the overall experience. I highly recommend this approach to anyone not driving to the studio, as it allows for a seamless transition back to daily life.

I appreciated Thimela's suggestion to take a day or two off work following the session to maintain the relaxation and freshness attained. It was evident when I went to work the next day feeling a bit tired and drained. Following Thimela's advice on consuming good food, staying hydrated, avoiding sugar, and focusing on high-nutrient foods further contributed to sustaining the positive effects of the session.

In conclusion, my visit to Chakra Mama Healing with Thimela was truly transformative, and I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a holistic healing experience. Thimela's expertise and guidance create a nurturing environment for relaxation and self-care. Thank you for a wonderful experience!

We can’t say enough amazing things about Chaa Creek!

He’s a treasure, we enjoyed the breakfasts and dinners he and his wife prepared, but mostly sharing time and stories around the table was the most fun and we learned so much from talking with Docio!
While at Chaa Creek, we went to Xunantunich Ruins with the best guide, Kevlin. We had a great time listening to the history and learning about the ruins. We also had a lot of laughs and will never forget the experience he offered.
We also went cave tubing with another great guide, Darren! He showed us so many cool things, like the cave inside the cave, the bat cave and explained the different formations. He was truly a wealth of knowledge. The tubing and swimming were an added bonus beyond the cave exploration.

The kids area had a clown that was screaming into a fuzzy microphone All i could hear is static mixed with screaming . I ddn’t  find anything humorous with just it, it just hurt my ears. The few booths that I did want to speak to I couldn’t even hear. I had to grab a card and reconnect later.

Also there was no options to eat at the show.  There was one food truck selling burgers for $17. I didn’t feed my kids before i left as I figured we would all eat lunch there. Thank god the dry meat booth was there   to sooth our kids until we left.

How did you feel before embarking on this experience, and how did you feel afterward?

Honestly I had not expectations prior to the Reiki session, and did have curiosity in whether my lower chakras would be activated, and boy they were. It’s the first time I’ve had all my chakras engaged in releasing through the shakes the energy I needed to move. I also was pleasantly surprised that Fleur was able to connect to my spirit guides and spirit animal. It was a confirmation that they are always there by my side.

What was your absolute favorite aspect of the entire experience?

Fleur makes the experience so safe and authentic. She has a beautiful calming energy, and is so present in listening and sharing her own experiences at the same time making it relatable. She is beautiful human being, with a gift of knowing what you need.

In your eyes, what made this training truly stand out from others you may have encountered?

The beyond reiki workshop has been amazing. The whole program is well thought out, and has a system to follow. It’s lovely to hear everyone’s experiences at the end of the session.

If you were to recommend this experience to others, what would be the main reason behind your recommendation?

Fleur is amazing with what she does. Great communicator, and really comes from her own experiences which are relatable as we all go through the various emotions, thoughts, and life experiences to grow and learn from. She is an amazing teacher, friend, and a mentor. Highly recommend taking her courses.",False

I would definitely recommend setting aside at least 4 hours if you want to see everything comfortably and really enjoy the full experience. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, always happy to answer questions or share interesting facts about the animals.

The hotel boasts a prime beachfront location, but direct beach access is limited due to a cement wall, which takes away from the oceanfront experience. During our stay, the beach was covered in seaweed, which made it difficult to enjoy the shoreline.

On the positive side, the resort features stunning pools, including a fun wave pool that’s perfect for young children. The in-room amenities, like the refrigerator, worked well. However, I felt the overall service could have been more reflective of the local culture. The restaurant options leaned heavily toward Italian and pizza—perhaps appealing to some, but it left me wondering: who comes to Cancun for Italian food?

As longtime members of the hotel, our experience was especially bittersweet. A close family member dedicated over 30 years of service to this hotel, and yet, we felt the hospitality extended to us was less than what regular guests receive. It’s not a popular opinion, but I firmly believe employees and their families—who have shown deep loyalty—should be treated with exceptional appreciation and care.

The hotel’s location in the hotel zone is convenient, but traffic in the area can be heavy, making it difficult to explore.

We were blessed that there were only two (full-time) students on our teacher training course, meaning we got the full care and attention of Miel and Alex. Casa Chakras is located around 20 minutes from the centre and is quite rural (in comparison to the busy town centre, which I would also recommend visiting).
The quiet tranquillity we found at Casa Chakras was the perfect partner to aid our learning experience, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the rich culture presented. We took a few trips to the beach, participated in a wonderful Mayan canoe tour, and swam in the local cenote (quite scary as I'd never swam in a place like it before, but very culturally significant so a must in my opinion); however, nothing topped the morning yoga classes or evening somatic practices we had each day.
I must also thank Ambar, who was one of the highlights of our trip! Her light and eagerness to be involved brought us right back to being girls, encouraging us to let loose and simply have fun, integrating the deep knowledge we gained through laughter, playing mermaids in the pool and dance parties.
Miel created such a safe place to deepen our yoga practice, connect to the spirit within us and acted as a wonderful role model on how we would like to live our lives. I am forever grateful to be welcomed into the Casa Chakra Ashram!
If you have any doubts about selecting Casa Chakra, just do it. The journey is tough as you are taught a lot of information in a short amount of time, and have your own memories and experiences come up, but it was one of the best decisions I have ever made.
Casa Chakra is a place to immerse yourself in the yogic life, to find peace coming out of your comfort zone and connect with yourself, it's, a safe haven.",False

I want to begin this review with a feeling of deep frustration and anguish. As a customer, I have had the misfortune of working with Karrara, and I can say without a doubt that it has been the worst experience I have had with any supplier in my entire life.

From the beginning, the company has demonstrated a complete lack of professionalism and commitment to established deadlines. The lies regarding delivery times and the arrival of materials were constant, which generated anxiety and confusion that I cannot describe in words. Every time I tried to get clear information, I found answers that were vague, evasive and completely far from reality. It's as if they don't care one bit about the well-being or peace of mind of their clients.

What finally broke my patience, however, was the negligent treatment I received in my own home, and the rude treatment I received from the team, and from Freddy (who says he is the owner of the company).

Not only did they fail to meet the quality standards I expected from a company that is supposed to be professional, but they also damaged my walls, floors, baseboards during the process.

Despite being informed of these damages, (by all means of WhatsApp, calls, etc.. where they do not answer for long periods of time... responding only with a ""thank you for your patience"", but even so they continue to leave me in the air) they did not take responsibility or show any willingness to repair the damage caused, leaving an even deeper feeling of distrust.

As a customer, I experienced constant anguish as my service expectations were increasingly overwhelmed by a totally different reality. Not only did they fail fundamentally, but they did so in such a contemptuous manner that it is difficult for me to understand how they continue to operate.

For all the above, my most sincere recommendation is that you avoid working with Karrara at all costs. Not only are they incompetent, but they lack any type of responsibility in their service. My intention with this review is not only to share my experience, but also to help other people not have to go through the same suffering and frustration that I experienced when trusting them. I don't want anyone else to be in the same distressing situation that I experienced.",False

From the very first interaction with the legal team I felt very comfortable to ask or share any question/concern I had about the daunting undertaking ( at least, in my eyes.) Even the receptionist engaged with me in a patient and customer-friendly manner (first impressions matter!!)

Every step of the process was dealt with high levels of professionalism and assurances that this team meant business and left no stone unturned, when coming to justice for the client, and more importantly, for me, forging clear lines of communication. This was imperative in my eyes since it developed within me a confidence that I was in good hands; where abiding by authentic legal standards and care for my needs, were harmoniously delivered. They listened first and then guided accordingly.
I also appreciated the efficiency and timeliness applied towards the completion of all legal documents/letters, ensuring that my process ran with a steady momentum - there was no wasting of time or money!! I loved that!

Needless to say, the attorneys at this Law Chamber brought me in for a smooth process and landing and my divorce has been finalized. 🙏🏽

I highly recommend the Aurora Law Chambers team - Cari Chandler-Martin and Peggy Francis-Pierre - to anyone seeking the utmost standard of law practice and for those - like me - who value client care, rapport and timely deliverables.

Well done! 👌🏽

I literally told her that I was cool toned and it wouldn’t look good on me, but she just dismissed me and said I wear gold jewelry? Like I don’t know my own skin tone?
It was such an impersonal experience. When I first sat down, she IMMEDIATELY tried to sell me an $90 conditioner. She had 3-4 clients while I was there. Here’s the real kicker, she originally glazed my hair wrong, so she had to reglaze it (which is okay whatever I’m glad you’re fixing it) but after the reglaze they said I could either wait 30 minutes for someone to blow dry my hair or I could do it myself. I literally almost started sobbing in the salon, I felt so humiliated and embarrassed. After like 10 minutes, my (so so lovely and kind) hair washer came over to help me, I think because my eyes were watering.
The worst of all? I paid $350 AND THEY DIDNT EVEN CUT MY HAIR!!! Who does that?! I go to a lot of bougie salons because I love my hair and it’s like my self care, I have never been to one that doesn’t even include a trim?

We ordered drinks and appetizers. The appetizers arrived first, and the drinks — just one water and two teas — came about 10 minutes later. The water was warm, and they didn’t even offer ice.

Even though the place was almost empty, they sat someone right next to us smoking hookah. It looked very unprofessional. There should be a separate smoking area, especially with so much space available.

The food wasn’t good for the price. The staff seemed untrained — not because they didn’t want to offer good service, but because they clearly lacked basic knowledge of proper restaurant service and the correct order of serving items.

The salon has a really friendly atmosphere, and Charlotte is certainly a skilled specialist in many treatments and haircuts. Unfortunately, my experience with layering didn’t go well.

I have thick, frizzy, and slightly curly hair, so I asked for volume reduction and layering. I also showed a photo as inspiration (it's included in the attached photos). Charlotte assured me she could do it.

During the haircut, I noticed that the hair was being cut too high, so I expressed my concerns. Charlotte suggested that I ""trust the process,"" which I did. In the end, I asked for a bit of adjustment to the front, based on what I could see.

I waited two weeks before writing this review, trying to get used to the hairstyle, but my hair just looks odd – it’s cut at different lengths and doesn't resemble the photo I showed at all.

I strongly advise against flying this airline. My 30-hour journey from Tampa to Tonga ended in complete frustration due to their unprofessionalism and lack of customer care.

After finally arriving in Tongatapu, I had one short flight left to reach my destination for a once-in-a-lifetime swimming-with-whales experience. This final flight was critical—but the airline caused me to miss the first day of my trip.

Before traveling, I contacted the airline to confirm my connection time was sufficient. I received no reply until after the incident, when a supervisor casually emailed saying I “should have plenty of time.”

I reached the domestic terminal with 20 minutes to spare—tight, but the plane was still on the runway. Staff refused to let me board, claiming it would create 30 minutes of extra paperwork. When I asked to take the 4:00 PM flight, I was told it had been canceled three days earlier.

They offered me a flight the next morning instead, making me miss the first day of my whale experience. When I asked for a hotel voucher, they refused, and the airport closed for the night—leaving me stranded in the rain. I had to rely on the kindness of a stranger to find a hotel, which was unsafe and unpleasant.

Despite multiple calls and emails, no one has responded to confirm whether I will be refunded for my unused return flight. I am still paying for it, and the airline refuses to communicate. I ultimately paid $500 to rebook my return through Fiji at my own expense.

This airline has been in the media repeatedly for aviation, compliance, and safety issues since it began operations in 2020. Tonga’s civil aviation authority even suspended their maintenance certificate due to a lack of qualified engineers. Their service is as alarming as their safety record.

I will never fly this airline again, and I sincerely hope it goes out of business soon.",False

The whole place is absolutely beautiful, the gardens, dining areas, pool and walkways are all so well looked after. We were actually surprised by how spacious it felt. With only four bungalows spread out across the property, each with its own lovely garden space, it never felt crowded. They easily could have fit more, but the choice to keep it small and peaceful really made a difference.

Anne and Petter were absolutely lovely, so welcoming and accommodating, and they really went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Laura and Ed were also fantastic, full of great advice for things to do, and all the other staff were equally helpful and friendly.

The food was beautiful, with so much care put into using fresh local produce meaning every meal felt really special. And having the beach literally out the front was perfect. The reef starts just meters off the shore, and the amount of marine life right there was amazing with so many fish and corals, and all the snorkeling gear was provided (and really good quality too). As keen snorkelers, having such easy access to the reef was a huge highlight.

We also loved being just outside of town — far enough to be peaceful and quiet, but still only a quick bike ride or bus trip into town when we wanted.

The menus for lunch and dinner had a fantastic selection and something for everyone.  Pizzas were great, the beef burger was so tasty, and the pasta was amazing.  Had a desert a couple of nights, and it was delicious. The resort has no paved paths it is just sand everywhere, so it can make walking slightly difficult if you have any leg/feet issues.

We were warmly welcomed by Miguel and his family and immediately felt at home. Our accommodation was a cozy cabin in the middle of nature, surrounded by mountains, peace and a very special energy.

We ate together with the family every day, which created a warm, familiar atmosphere. The mood at the retreat was consistently relaxed, mindful and supportive. The daily meditations and preparatory exercises for the ceremony really helped me to find inner peace. Although I had hardly any previous experience with meditation, I felt well guided and safe.

The ayahuasca ceremony itself took place in Miguel's house - at first I was surprised, but it quickly became clear that this protected, intimate space was exactly the right place for such a profound experience. Miguel is a very sensitive, experienced shaman. He manages to hold the necessary space with great calm and at the same time be present when support is needed.

During the ceremony, I was able to experience unexpected insights - including memories from my childhood that I had long forgotten. It was healing, deeply moving and I felt safe and in good hands at all times. Even the day after, although our stay was officially over, Miguel warmly invited us to lunch together.

Whether you are experiencing an ayahuasca ceremony for the first time or already have experience, I can wholeheartedly recommend the Wizard Mountain Healing Center and Miguel's work. I am very much looking forward to my next visit.

I enjoyed it so much that I booked there again, but this time they gave me a room at the ancient building.

And what a terrible experience!!!

All furniture looks from the 70's, sheets are almost transparent, and even the smell was so bad that they had to put little scent trees hanging all over the room and bathroom.
I complained with management, but they didn't show any interest in putting some effort into helping me.

I don’t usually go to Java but this day I went out of pure desperation (it was raining, I was staying nearby and I wanted food for my baby).

There were two customers ahead of me (one having just pastries, the other a small pick up order) and it took over 20 minutes to get two slices of soggy toast and extremely dry eggs costing $2000 (this price does not include the coffee). The price wouldn’t have offended me if the food had any quality.  Unfortunately, Java does not offer quality. My 1 year old, who loves eggs and toast, did not eat this food. I did not either.

The barista was pleasant and made a decent latte. It was lukewarm but I could tell she was scared to burn the milk so I just let that slide. It was good foam. I don’t like their coffee bean (personal preference). It’s the sour+bitter aftertaste of green coffee beans.

Also, please tell me you see the hair/eyelash on the cucumber for extra flavor!

Delicious vegetarian breakfast and dinner are included and allowed us to taste fresh offerings from the on-site gardens - which are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen. In the dining room, we ate with other travelers, which was an absolute treat. We met lovely people. Also in the dining area, there was always hot water and herbs from the garden available for authentic tea.

The rooms are fantastic, including wonderful showers. The rooms are clean and roomy. We stayed during the South American winter, and every night the staff placed two hot water bottles in our sheets. What a treat!

Speaking of the staff, they were professional, polite, and effective.

We were fortunate enough to experience the outdoor hot water baths with Jasmine and eucalyptus leaves. They were unforgettable.

I really can't say enough about what a wonderful place Willka T'ika is.",False
